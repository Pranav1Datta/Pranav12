            <h2>Kazuma Kiryu</h2>
            <p>Kazuma Kiryu is the main protagonist of the Yakuza game series. Known as the "Dragon of Dojima," he is a legendary figure in the criminal underworld.</p>
            <p>One of his strongest moral tendencies is his strong protectiveness towards women, children, the elderly, and animals.</p>
            <p>Kiryu is shown to be somewhat awkward towards everyday life situations, often becoming flustered and bewildered whenever women make advances or when he sees civilians get involved in bizarre and awkward situations.</p>
